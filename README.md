# Jellyfin RFFMPEG Swarm

This project creates a scalable, distributed Jellyfin media server using Docker Swarm. It solves the common challenge of CPU-intensive video transcoding by offloading the work from the main Jellyfin server to a cluster of dedicated worker nodes.

## Overview

The architecture is composed of two primary services that communicate over a secure Docker overlay network:

-   **`jellyfin-server`**: The main Jellyfin instance. It does not perform transcodes itself but instead delegates them to available workers via SSH using `rffmpeg`. This service also runs an integrated **NFS server** to share the `/transcodes` and `/cache` directories, ensuring all nodes have access to the same temporary files. **Logs for `rffmpeg` are automatically viewable in the Jellyfin Dashboard under the "Logs" section.**
-   **`transcode-worker`**: The workhorses of the cluster. These are lightweight, scalable containers that listen for transcoding jobs from the server. You can add or remove workers on-the-fly to match your expected transcoding load.

## Host Setup Guide

The following steps must be performed on **all nodes** in your Docker Swarm cluster to ensure they are properly configured.

### 1. OS and Hardware
-   **Operating System**: A recent Debian or Ubuntu LTS release.
-   **CPU**: An Intel CPU that supports Quick Sync Video (QSV).
-   **Storage**: An SSD is highly recommended for the `/transcodes` and `/cache` directories to handle the high I/O of transcoding.

### 2. Install System Dependencies
Install the necessary packages for NFS client/server functionality and Intel hardware acceleration.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nfs-common nfs-kernel-server intel-opencl-icd
```

### 3. Configure Kernel and Drivers
-   **Load Kernel Modules**: Ensure the required NFS and Intel graphics modules are loaded on boot.
    ```bash
    sudo sh -c "echo 'nfsd' >> /etc/modules"
    sudo sh -c "echo 'nfs' >> /etc/modules"
    sudo modprobe nfsd nfs
    ```
-   **Enable Intel QSV**: Follow the official Jellyfin documentation to enable Intel QSV, apply any necessary kernel patches, and configure Low-Power (LP) mode for your hardware.

    -   **Known Issues & Fixes**: https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/post-install/transcoding/hardware-acceleration/known-issues#intel-on-linux

### 4. Create Host Directories
Create the directories on the host that the `jellyfin-server` container will use for its internal NFS exports.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /transcodes /cache
sudo chgrp users /transcodes /cache
sudo chmod 775 /transcodes /cache
```

### 5. Disable AppArmor (Critical)
AppArmor's security policies prevent the `jellyfin-server` container from acquiring the permissions needed to run its own NFS server. It must be disabled on the host.

As an alternative to disabling AppArmor entirely, you can try adding the following `security_opt` to the `transcode-worker` service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. **Note:** This has not been tested.
```yml
services:
  transcode-worker:
    # ... other options
    security_opt:
      - apparmor:unconfined
```

If you choose not to use the `security_opt`, you can disable AppArmor on the host with the following commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop apparmor && sudo systemctl disable apparmor
sudo apt purge -y apparmor
# This command adds 'apparmor=0' to the kernel boot parameters
sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="\(.*\)"/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="\1 apparmor=0"/' /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub
```
**A reboot is required** for this change to take effect.

### 6. Configure Docker Swarm
-   Install Docker and initialize your Swarm cluster if you haven't already.
-   Deploy the `device-mapping-manager` on each node. This utility ensures that GPU devices (`/dev/dri`) are correctly mapped to containers across the Swarm.
    ```bash
    docker run -d --restart always --name device-manager --privileged \
      --cgroupns=host --pid=host --userns=host \
      -v /sys:/host/sys -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      ghcr.io/gitdeath/device-mapping-manager:master
    ```

## Production Deployment

Follow these steps on your Docker Swarm manager node.

### 1. Prepare Deployment Files
Create a directory for your stack and download the compose file.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/jellyfin-swarm && cd ~/jellyfin-swarm
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitdeath/jellyfin-rffmpeg-swarm/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Generate and Store SSH Keys
Generate an SSH key pair and store it securely as Docker secrets. These keys are used for communication between the server and workers.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ./rffmpeg_id_rsa -q -N ""

# Create the secrets in Docker Swarm
docker secret create jellyfin_rffmpeg_id_rsa ./rffmpeg_id_rsa
docker secret create jellyfin_rffmpeg_id_rsa_pub ./rffmpeg_id_rsa.pub

# For security, remove the key files from the host after creating the secrets
rm ./rffmpeg_id_rsa ./rffmpeg_id_rsa.pub
```

### 3. Configure and Deploy
Before deploying, you **must** edit `docker-compose.yml` and update the `volumes` section to point to your external NFS server for `media`, `jellyfin_config`, and `livetv`.

```bash
# Example of editing the file
nano docker-compose.yml

# Deploy the stack
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml jellyfin
```

### 4. Verify and Scale
Check the status of your services to ensure they are running correctly.
```bash
docker stack services jellyfin
```
Once verified, you can access the Jellyfin UI at `http://<YOUR_SWARM_IP>:8096` and scale your workers as needed.
```bash
# Scale to 5 workers
docker service scale jellyfin_transcode-worker=5
```

## Development Environment

The "development" environment is designed for testing pre-release (Release Candidate or Unstable) versions of Jellyfin, not for development of this project itself. It allows you to run a separate, isolated Jellyfin instance using the `:dev` image tags, which are built using the `JELLYFIN_DEV` version specified in `versions.env`.

This repository includes a `docker-compose.dev.yml` file for deploying this test environment.

### 1. Deploy the Dev Stack
1.  Download the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file.
2.  **Important**: Edit the `volumes` section to point to separate `_dev` paths on your NFS server to avoid data conflicts with production.
3.  Deploy the stack with a unique name (e.g., `jellyfin-dev`).

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitdeath/jellyfin-rffmpeg-swarm/main/docker-compose.dev.yml
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.dev.yml jellyfin-dev
```

### 2. Development SSH Keys
The development stack requires its own set of SSH keys to maintain isolation.
```bash
# Generate a new key pair specifically for development
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ./rffmpeg_id_rsa_dev -q -N ""

# Create the development secrets in Docker Swarm
docker secret create jellyfin_rffmpeg_id_rsa_dev ./rffmpeg_id_rsa_dev
docker secret create jellyfin_rffmpeg_id_rsa_pub_dev ./rffmpeg_id_rsa_dev.pub
```

## DVR and Live TV Features

This project is pre-configured to enhance Jellyfin's DVR functionality with automated commercial processing.

### Recording Path

The default recording path is automatically set to `/livetv`. You **must** configure the `livetv` volume in `docker-compose.yml` to point to a persistent storage location for your DVR recordings. On your NAS, ensure the exported directory has write permissions for the `users` group (GID 100) to allow the server to save recordings and post-processing files.

### Automated Commercial Processing

The `jellyfin-server` is configured to automatically run a post-processing script on recordings. This script uses `comskip` to detect commercials and has two modes:

-   **`comchap` (Default)**: This non-destructive mode adds chapter markers to the video file, allowing you to skip commercial breaks easily.
-   **`comcut` (Optional)**: This destructive mode creates a new version of the recording with commercials physically removed, then replaces the original file.

You can change this behavior from the Jellyfin dashboard by navigating to **Dashboard -> Live TV -> DVR Settings** and editing the **Post-processor command line arguments** field.
-   To enable commercial cutting, change the value to: `"{path}" comcut`
-   To use the default chapter mode, use: `"{path}" comchap`
-   **Verbose Logging**: To get more detailed logs for troubleshooting, you can add the `--verbose` flag, e.g., `"{path}" comchap --verbose`. 

Logs for all post-processing jobs are stored in `/config/log/` and are viewable directly in the **Jellyfin Dashboard** under the "Logs" section.

## Default Hardware Acceleration

This project automatically configures Jellyfin for Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) hardware acceleration to provide excellent transcoding performance out-of-the-box.

The default settings are conservative to ensure broad compatibility with most Intel CPUs that support QSV (approximately 7th generation and newer).

### Improving Performance on Newer Hardware

If your server and worker nodes have newer Intel CPUs (e.g., 9th generation or newer), you can often achieve better performance or efficiency by enabling more advanced transcoding features.

You can customize these settings in the Jellyfin dashboard under **Dashboard -> Playback -> Transcoding**. For example, on supported hardware, you may want to enable:

-   **Intel Low-Power HEVC hardware encoder**

Always test changes to ensure stability with your specific hardware.

## Architecture Deep Dive: The Embedded NFS Server

A key feature of this project is the NFS server running *inside* the `jellyfin-server` container. This is a deliberate design choice to solve a critical problem in distributed transcoding.

-   **Why it's necessary**: When a worker transcodes a file, it writes temporary chunks and the final output to a specific path (e.g., `/transcodes/xyz.ts`). The main Jellyfin server must then be able to read from that *exact same path* to serve the file to the client. By having the server export `/transcodes` and `/cache`, we guarantee that both the server and all workers share a consistent, writable view of these directories.
-   **Performance**: For optimal performance, the `/transcodes` and `/cache` directories on the host running the `jellyfin-server` should be located on a fast, local SSD. This changes the I/O pattern for transcoded data from a costly "read from NAS, write to NAS, read from NAS" cycle to a much more efficient "read from NAS, write to local SSD, read from local SSD" workflow. This significantly reduces I/O load on your primary storage array.
-   **Elevated Privileges**: Mounting an NFS share from within a container requires elevated privileges. This is why the `transcode-worker` service needs `cap_add: [SYS_ADMIN]` in the compose file. This allows it to run `mount -a` and connect to the server's exports.
-   **The `fsid` Option**: The NFS exports in the `docker-compose.yml` file include an `fsid` (File System ID) option (e.g., `fsid=1`). This is required by NFSv4 to uniquely identify each exported directory, especially when the underlying host directories (`/config`, `/transcodes`, `/cache`) might reside on different physical disks or partitions. Without unique `fsid`s, the NFS server would fail to start.
-   **Troubleshooting**: If workers fail to start, check their logs for `mount` errors. This usually indicates a problem with network connectivity to the server container or a lack of `SYS_ADMIN` capability.
